This repository contains the **Cloud Resume Project**, a serverless, full-stack application showcasing modern DevOps and AWS best practices. It hosts a personal resume site on AWS S3 and CloudFront, tracks page views with DynamoDB and Lambda, and automates infrastructure and deployments using Terraform and GitHub Actions.

## Project Overview

This project includes:

- A static resume site hosted on **S3**, delivered through **CloudFront**  
- A visitor counter built using **AWS Lambda** (Python) and **DynamoDB**  
- Fully provisioned infrastructure using **Terraform**  
- Automated deployment using **GitHub Actions** for both frontend and backend  

It was an amazing way to get hands-on with AWS, serverless tech, and DevOps workflows.
